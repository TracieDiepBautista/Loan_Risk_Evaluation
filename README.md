    Predicting Credit Risk for Bank Loans Using Machine Learning.
    
    LendingClub is a peer-to-peer lending services company that allows individual investors to partially 
    fund personal loans as well as buy and sell notes backing the loans on a secondary market. 
    LendingClub offers their previous data through an API.

    As a Data Scientist, the task was to use this data to create machine learning models to classify 
    the risk level of given loans. Specifically, comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier.

    In a nother saying, the task was to build a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan from LendingClub 
    will become high risk or not.

    - Readme.md file: this file to give general information about the Project and analysis in conslusive summaries (Risk evaluation). 
    - Resources folder: the data pulled out from Lending Club API to use for Prediction.
      + Generation: codes to prep-process data sources. 
    - the .ipynb file: the codes to pre-process data, apply module, classification, scalling, linear Regression 
      & further works to turn out predicting results.

- Risk Evaluation:
```
    - When applied two models Logistic Regression and Random Forest Classifier Models, the scores reached 0.71 
      and 0.79 respectively; 
    - Overall: The two models were both turned out good score that show accuracy reached a high level; the risks were classified more low than the high.
      The prediction for 2020 Loan Risk were high accurate. 
    - Specific model picked: The Random Forest got the higher score, we may say, this model works better than the another.
